# Networking

Network - Two or more computers or devices that are linked in order to share information.

Networking refers to a large set of standards and protocols that organize and regulate the sharing of information.

## Glossary

The Internet - Refers to the actual network of connected computing devices.

The World Wide Web - Collection of interlinked websites and other web resources that use the internet to share data.

The Client-Server Model - Describes how the flow of data is transferred on the internet.

Web 2.0 Applications - Provide a dynamic user experience by:

- Responding to user input without having to reload the page
- Emphasizing user-generated content and social sharing.

    !!! info "FYI"
        This was made possible through technical advances such as JQuery and web frameworks.

TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) are standards for data transfer which allow networks all over the globe to communicate with each other.

## OSI Model

Open Systems Interconnection is a conceptual, implementation-neutral model that describes networking in seven separate layers, where each layer covers a set of functions and tasks. This model helps us communicate while we do network troubleshooting and architecture.

TCP/IP Model - An implementation-specific networking model that revolves around the TCP protocol and IP addressing which anchor the Internet as we know it.

!!! abstract "OSI vs TCP/IP"

    OSI layers include:

    | Layer           | Description                                                        |
    |-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Physical        | Includes physical technologies                                     |
    | Data Link       | Data framing and local MAC addressing                              |
    | Network         | Connecting to the larger web and IP addressing                     |
    | Transport       | Protocols that make sure reliable delivery happens                 |
    | Session         | Authenticates and maintains communication over a period of time    |
    | Presentation    | En/decrypts and translates data into presentable form              |
    | Application     | All the applications we interact with that render data             |

    TCP/IP layers:

    - The Network Layer
    - The Internet Layer
    - The Transport Layer
    - The Application Layer

## Network Categories

- **LAN (Local Area Network)** - a smaller-sized network that connects multiple devices in a small area
- **CAN (Campus Area Network)** - a larger network that connects multiple computers and devices over a slightly larger area
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)** -  the largest-sized network that connects multiple computers, over a geographically large area. The Internet is technically a WAN.

## Network Protocols

Set of standards for Internet traffic.

| Protocol      | Purpose/Description                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| TCP and UDP  | Transport protocols for reliable and fast delivery  |
| HTTP         | Web requests                                        |
| DNS          | Convert domain names to IP addresses                |
| IMAP/POP3    | Email                                               |
| SSH          | Secure remote access                                |
| FTP          | File transfer                                       |
| SMB          | Access to specific resources                        |
